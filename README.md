```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/ai-model \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"model": "openai-gpt-3", "prompt": "Hello, world!"}'
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "response": "Hello, world! How can I assist you today?"
}
```

This example demonstrates how to interact with an AI model using a simple POST request. You can customize the model and prompt as needed.
